\usage{
stp(tardis, points, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tardis}{A object of class 'tardis' from create_tardis.}

\item{points}{A two or three column matrix giving the spatiotemporal coordinates.
Column ordering is assumed to be longitude (decimal degrees), latitude (decimal
degrees) and time (positive, years before present).}

\item{verbose}{A logical indicating whether function progress should be
reported to the user}
}
\value{
A three column data.frame containing the final point longitudes and
latitudes, with the third column recording the point adjustment distance in
metres. For unadjusted points, this will be zero. For points which could
not be successfully adjusted, this will be NA.
}
\description{
Check a set of space-time coordinates to determine whether they fall within
an accessible cell within a TARDIS object. The function first checks whether
all points fall within the spatial and temporal extents of the object. From
there, it checks whether the points fall within an accessible cell in their
respective time layers and will adjust discrepant points to their nearest
accessible cell using great circle distances. Adjustment is performed using
a rip of nearestLand() from seegSDM, up to a maximum of 10000 km, although
it is expected that any adjustments will be nowhere near this large.
