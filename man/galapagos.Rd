\description{
Load a terra 'SpatRaster' object from a source tiff containing four
palaeogeographic digital elevation models and one modern digital elevation
model of the Galapagos archipelago. Models are in geographic coordinates with
elevations in metres above sea level.
}
\details{
Each DEM records the topography and bathymetry of the archipelago
at 0.5 million-year intervals from 2 million years ago to the present. As
such, each time slice is taken to represent the 0.25 million years either
side of these average points (i.e., the 2 Ma reconstruction spans 2.25-1.75
Ma).

The palaeogeographic reconstructions were interpolated from an irregular grid
and additionally contain artefacts. As such, they should only be treated as
toy datasets, rather than wholly accurate, and later versions are expected to
be released in the future.

The present day reconstruction was sourced from the Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory from data comppiled by William Chadwick, Oregon
State University, although it has been downscaled to palaeogeographic
resolution and so should again be treated as an example dataset, rather than
the basis for a scientifically robust analysis.
