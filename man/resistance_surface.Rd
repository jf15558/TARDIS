\usage{
resistance_surface(tardis, weights = NULL, verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{tardis}{An object of class 'tardis', produced by create_tardis}

\item{weights}{If not NULL, a vector of weights to be used instead of the
geographic distances in x. All entries must be >= 0 and finite (no NaN or
Inf), or NA. Typically the output of weight_tardis}

\item{verbose}{A logical indicating whether function progress should be
reported to the user.}
}
\value{
A SpatRaster with each layer corresponding to the original landscape
layers in the graph, and cell values calculated as the mean of its inbound edge weights.
}
\description{
Convenience function to visualise the weighting scheme for the layers in a
tardis object. Two options are available, one to visualise the empirical
geographic distance weights in the landscapes, the other to visualise a
custom weighting scheme.
