\usage{
lcp(tardis, weights = NULL, origin, dest, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tardis}{An object of class 'tardis', produced by create_tardis}

\item{weights}{If not NULL, a vector of weights to be used instead of the
geographic distances in tardis. All entries must be >= 0
and finite (NaN or Inf), or NA. Typically the output of weight_tgraph}

\item{origin}{A simple features collection produced by stp, denoting
the starting points of the least cost paths}

\item{dest}{As for origin. The user should be careful to the time ordering
of point pairs matches the time linking mode if tardis contains multiple
layers. For example, points in younger layers (higher bin numbers) will not
be accessible from points in older layers (lower bin numbers) if the linking
mode of tardis is backwards in time (tlink = 2)}

\item{verbose}{A logical indicating whether function progress should be
reported to the user.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements: 1. 'paths', a simple features linestring
geometry collection representing the time-discrete portions of each least
cost path; 2. 'costs', a data.frame containing the geographic and weighted
costs of each least cost path (identical when weights = NULL); 3. 'cells',
a list of cell IDs comprising each least cost path.
}
\description{
Determine least cost paths through a spatiotemporal landscape graph. Least
cost paths are identified between pairs of origin and destination coordinates
using Djikstra's algorithm. Costs are either geographic distances or a custom
weighting scheme supplied by the user.
