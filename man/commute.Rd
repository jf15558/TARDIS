\usage{
commute(tardis, weights = NULL, origin, dest, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tardis}{An object of class 'tardis', produced by create_tardis}

\item{weights}{If not NULL, a vector of weights to be used instead of the
geographic distances in tardis. All entries must be >= 0
and finite (NaN or Inf), or NA. Typically the output of weight_tgraph}

\item{origin}{A simple features collection produced by stp, denoting
the origin cells for the commutes}

\item{dest}{As for origin, but for the destination points. Unlike for lcp
the directionality in time does not matter}

\item{verbose}{A logical indicating whether function progress should be
reported to the user.}
}
\value{
A list of vectors containing the layer-discrete commute times for
each segment of the input least cost paths
}
\description{
Calculate the commute time between the start and end of a least cost path.
The commute time is the degree of 'resistance' between two points in a
graph and provides a measure of the practical difficulty of traversing
between them, regardless of the optimal route offered by the intervening
least cost path. The commute time calculation requires a graph with
bidirectional edges. Consequently, the average of the weights for pairs of
edges are calculated within each graph layer, rather than considering their
potential asymmetries.
